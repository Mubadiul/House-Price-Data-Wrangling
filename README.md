### **Data Processing - House Price**
**Code:** [House Price Data wrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/house_price_data_wrangling.ipynb)

This project focuses on exploring and processing house price data using Python. The first step is to understand the dataset structure by examining data types and detecting missing values. Missing values are handled based on their nature, distinguishing between truly missing values and those intentionally marked as "NA" to indicate the absence of a specific feature. Next, numerical and categorical data are processed with appropriate imputation techniques. This is followed by detecting and handling outliers using the IQR method to ensure a more representative data distribution. Visual analyses, such as boxplots and probability distributions, are used to identify patterns within the dataset. With this approach, the dataset is prepared for further analysis or predictive modeling to determine factors influencing house prices.
